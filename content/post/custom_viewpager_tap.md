## Introduction

Android provides a range of components that allow developers to create engaging
and intuitive user interfaces. One such component is the **`ViewPager`**, a
layout
manager that allows users to flip through pages of data, akin to sliding through
pages of a book. But what if we could make this navigation even more intuitive?
What if a simple tap could transport you through pages? In this blog post, we'll
explore how to create a custom ViewPager that responds to single-tap events for
page navigation.

## Purpose

The traditional `ViewPager` in Android responds to swipe gestures for moving
between pages. However, there might be cases where you want a simpler
interaction, such as a single tap. Our aim here is to create a custom
`ViewPager`
that responds to single-tap events. Tapping on the left half of the screen will
take the user to the previous page, while tapping on the right half navigates to
the next page.

---

## How to Achieve That

To achieve this, we will extend the default ViewPager class and customize it to
handle our desired tap events. This involves using Android's `GestureDetector`,
which will enable us to listen for single-tap events and respond accordingly.

---

## Code Sample

Here's a sample code of a `custom ViewPager` in Java:

``` java
import android.content.Context;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.view.GestureDetector;
import android.view.MotionEvent;
import androidx.viewpager.widget.ViewPager;
import java.util.Objects;

public class CustomViewPager extends ViewPager {
    private GestureDetector gestureDetector;

    public CustomViewPager(Context context) {
        super(context);
        init(context);
    }

    public CustomViewPager(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
        init(context);
    }

    private void init(Context context) {
        gestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onSingleTapConfirmed(MotionEvent e) {
                float halfWidth = getWidth() / 2.0f;
                if (e.getX() < halfWidth) {
                    if (getCurrentItem() > 0) {
                        setCurrentItem(getCurrentItem() - 1, true);
                    }
                } else {
                    if (getCurrentItem() < Objects.requireNonNull(getAdapter()).getCount() - 1) {
                        setCurrentItem(getCurrentItem() + 1, true);
                    }
                }
                performClick();
                return super.onSingleTapConfirmed(e);
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
        performClick();
        gestureDetector.onTouchEvent(ev);
        return super.onTouchEvent(ev);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean performClick() {
        return super.performClick();
    }
}
```

## Code Breakdown

The `CustomViewPager` class extends the default `ViewPager` and modifies its
behavior through overriding certain methods and adding a `GestureDetector`. The
`GestureDetector` is set up to detect single-tap events, and based on the
location of the tap (left or right half of the screen), the ViewPager navigates
to the previous or next page respectively. This is done in the `init()` method,
which is called from both constructors.

The `onTouchEvent()` method is overridden to ensure that each touch event is
also sent to the `GestureDetector` for processing, and a click action is
performed for possible use by other components or accessibility services.

## How to Use the Custom ViewPager

The custom ViewPager can be used in your application just like any other view
component.

### **Java**

First, you need to create an instance of the CustomViewPager in your activity
and set an adapter to it:

```java
CustomViewPager customViewPager = new CustomViewPager(this);
PagerAdapter adapter = new CustomPagerAdapter(); // This should be your custom PagerAdapter
customViewPager.setAdapter(adapter);

setContentView(customViewPager);
```

You can also get the current item and set the current item programmatically:

```java
int currentItem = customViewPager.getCurrentItem();
customViewPager.setCurrentItem(currentItem + 1, true);
```

### **XML**

Alternatively, you can declare the CustomViewPager in your layout XML file and
reference it in your activity:

```xml

<com.example.yourapp.CustomViewPager
        android:id="@+id/customViewPager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

Then, in your activity:

```java
CustomViewPager customViewPager = (CustomViewPager) findViewById(R.id.customViewPager);
PagerAdapter adapter = new CustomPagerAdapter(); // This should be your custom PagerAdapter
customViewPager.setAdapter(adapter);
```

Remember, in order for the `ViewPager` to display anything, you will need to set
a `PagerAdapter` to it that supplies the views representing each page. Also,
replace `com.example.yourapp` with your actual package name in XML usage.

---

## Use Cases

The custom ViewPager is perfect for applications where users prefer minimal hand
movement or find swiping through pages inconvenient. It can also be beneficial
for applications targeting users with accessibility needs, as the single-tap
navigation may be easier for them to use. For example, in a digital book reading
app, this would allow users to navigate between pages with a single tap,
mimicking the act of flipping a book's page on either side.

---

## Conclusion

Enhancing the user experience is a crucial aspect of Android development. By
customizing a ViewPager to respond to single-tap events, we can make navigation
through an app's pages easier and more intuitive. While this post focused on
single-tap events, Android's `GestureDetector` offers a wide range of gesture
detection capabilities that developers can leverage to build engaging and
user-friendly interfaces.
